                <p>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computer systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of using hard-coded rules, ML algorithms analyze large datasets to find patterns, make predictions, and perform tasks, getting better over time as they are exposed to more data</p>

                <summary>Machine Learning Basics</summary>
                <p>Machine learning (ML) allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding data into algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions on new data. It is used in various applications like image recognition, speech processing, language translation, recommender systems, etc. In this article, we will see more about ML and its core concepts.</p>

                <summary>Python for Machine Learning</summary>
                <p>Python language is widely used in Machine Learning because it provides libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. These libraries offer tools and functions essential for data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models. It is well-known for its readability and offers platform independence. These all things make it the perfect language of choice for Machine Learning.

                    Machine Learning is a subdomain of artificial intelligence. It allows computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed, and It is designed in such a way that allows systems to identify patterns, make predictions, and make decisions based on data.
                    
                    So, let's start Python Machine Learning guide to learn more about ML.</p>

                <p>Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, creating or modifying features like input variables or data to help machine learning models learn patterns more effectively. It involves transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that improve model accuracy and performance.</p>

                <summary>Supervised Learning</summary>
                <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labelled data—meaning every input has a corresponding correct output. The model makes predictions and compares them with the true outputs, adjusting itself to reduce errors and improve accuracy over time. The goal is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. For example, a model trained on images of handwritten digits can recognise new digits it has never seen before.</p>

                <b>Machine Learning</b>  is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.
